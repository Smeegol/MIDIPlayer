# MIDIPlayer
Non Perfect MIDI Player

This is a audio player playing MIDI files by using `AUGraph`, `MusicSequence`, and `MusicPlayer`, which can play most MIDI files. You can test and compare the performance by using Sweet MIDI Player (http://www.ronimusic.com/download.htm#DL_SWEET_MIDI_PLAYER).

BUT there still 
`100.mid`, 
`100去踏板.mid`, 
`100去鼓.mid`, 
`100去鼓去踏板.mid`, 
`120.mid`, 
`120去鼓去贝司.mid`, 
`MIDI文件demo1（120）.mid`, 
`MIDI文件demo2（100）.mid` 
cannot be played very well. It can be recognized clearly not same with the Sweet MIDI Player plays. Who can help me fix it, let them play totally right? Thanks!
